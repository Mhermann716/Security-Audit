# Security Audits

## Objective

The objective of this security audits portfolio is to document and showcase theoretical audits, demonstrating my understanding of auditing principles, methodologies, and practices to highlight my analytical skills and preparedness for real-world security assessments.

### Skills Learned
- Risk Assessment and Management: Analyzing systems and networks to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats, and assessing their potential impact on an organization's operations and data integrity.
- Compliance Knowledge: Understanding regulatory requirements and industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS, and ensuring that systems and processes adhere to these standards..
- Policy Analysis and Development: Evaluating existing security policies and procedures, identifying gaps or weaknesses, and developing recommendations for improvement or new policy implementation..
- Security Framework Familiarity: Becoming proficient in security frameworks like NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO/IEC 27001, or CIS Controls, and applying their principles to assess and enhance cybersecurity posture.
- Communication and Reporting: Effectively communicating audit findings, risks, and recommendations to technical and non-technical stakeholders through clear and concise reports, presentations, and documentation.

### Tools Used

- Nessus: Nessus is a vulnerability assessment tool that scans networks, systems, and applications for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential security issues. It provides detailed reports on discovered vulnerabilities, prioritizing them based on severity.
- Wireshark: Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures and displays network packets in real-time. It helps auditors analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, identify security threats, and troubleshoot network issues.
- Nmap: Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It scans networks to identify active hosts, services, and open ports, providing valuable insights into network topology and potential security risks.
- Metasploit: Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that helps auditors simulate real-world cyber attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems and networks. It provides a wide range of tools and exploits for testing security defenses and assessing overall security posture.
